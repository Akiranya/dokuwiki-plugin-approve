====== Approve Assignments ======

Here you can define pages/namespaces where approve is used.
Additionally you can specify page maintainers who will receive notifications
about changes in maintained pages.

  * Namespaces excluding subnamespaces are assigned as ''<nowiki>namespace:*</nowiki>''.
  * Namespaces including subnamespaces are assigned as ''<nowiki>namespace:**</nowiki>''.
  * Pages as usual with their full page ID.
